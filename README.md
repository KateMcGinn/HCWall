# HCWall
The Final Javascript GA Project for HackCville

For my project, I want to create an Opportunities Board for a student club of mine.
the HC Wall will be a place where club leadership can post opportunities for students. It will also be a place where students of the club can post opportunities or project suggestions. The site itself will contain two pages: One where students cannot post, but where leadership can post curated ideas and one where students can post any opportunities they discover.

The site will feature a main page with one large picture. Two boxes on the middle of the page will direct to the curated wall (doesn't allow you to post) and the student wall (allows anyone to post).

View 1: Main page
